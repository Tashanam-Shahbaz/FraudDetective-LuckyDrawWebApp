Then, at 00:02:10, on the 1st of April 2018, a customer with ID 4961 made a payment of a value of 81.51 to a merchant with ID 3412, and that the transaction was not fraudulent. And so on.

Ordered means that the order of the values of a variable is meaningful.\n",

The identifiers for the transactions, customers, and terminals are numerical but not ordered: it would not make sense to assume for example that the terminal with ID 3548 is 'bigger' or 'larger' than the terminal with ID 1983. Rather, these identifiers represent distinct 'entities', which are referred to as *categorical* features.\n",

The topic is known in the machine learning literature as *feature engineering* or *feature transformation*.

The design of these features is usually problem-dependent, and involves domain knowledge.\n",

These features can be useful since it has been observed in real-world datasets that fraudulent patterns differ between weekdays and weekends, and between the day and night.  \n",

We will follow the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) framework proposed in {cite}`VANVLASSELAER201538`, and keep track of the average spending amount and number of transactions for each customer and for three window sizes. This will lead to the creation of six new features.\n",

We will take inspiration from the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) framework proposed in {cite}`VANVLASSELAER201538`, and compute two of these features over three time windows. The first feature will be the number of transactions that occur within a time window (Frequency). The second will be the average amount spent in these transactions (Monetary value). The time windows will be set to one, seven, and thirty days. This will generate six new features. Note that these time windows could later be optimized along with the models using a model selection procedure ([Chapter 5](Model_Selection)).\n",

The risk score will be defined as the average number of fraudulent transactions that occurred on a terminal ID over a time window. As for customer ID transformations, we will use three window sizes, of 1, 7, and 30 days.\n",

The delay period accounts for the fact that, in practice, the fraudulent transactions are only discovered after a fraud investigation or a customer complaint. Hence, the fraudulent labels, which are needed to compute the risk score, are only available after this delay period. To a first approximation, this delay period will be set to one week. The motivations for the delay period will be further argued in [Chapter 5, Validation strategies](Validation_Strategies).\n",

The function takes as inputs the DataFrame of transactions for a given terminal ID, the delay period, and a list of window sizes. In the first stage, the number of transactions and fraudulent transactions are computed for the delay period (`NB_TX_DELAY` and `NB_FRAUD_DELAY`). In the second stage, the number of transactions and fraudulent transactions are computed for each window size plus the delay period (`NB_TX_DELAY_WINDOW` and `NB_FRAUD_DELAY_WINDOW`). The number of transactions and fraudulent transactions that occurred for a given window size, shifted back by the delay period, is then obtained by simply computing the differences of the quantities obtained for the delay period, and the window size plus delay period:\n",
